# System Architecture Improvement Strategy

This document outlines a strategy for improving the architecture of the NixOS configuration while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Current Architecture Overview

The system currently uses a well-organized structure with:
- Centralized flake configuration
- Modular system configurations
- Host-specific overrides
- User-level configurations via Home Manager
- Clear separation of concerns

## Improvement Areas

### 1. Module Organization

**Current**: Modules are organized in a flat structure in the `modules/` directory.

**Improvement**: 
- Create subdirectories for better categorization:
  - `modules/system/` for core system services
  - `modules/desktop/` for desktop environment components
  - `modules/hardware/` for hardware-specific configurations
  - `modules/network/` for networking-related modules
  - `modules/security/` for security-related configurations

### 2. Configuration Abstraction

**Current**: Some configurations are duplicated across files or could be better abstracted.

**Improvement**:
- Create more reusable configuration functions
- Use `lib.mkDefault` and `lib.mkOverride` more strategically for better configuration merging
- Implement configuration hierarchies with clear precedence rules

### 3. Host Configuration Enhancement

**Current**: Host configurations are in separate directories but could be better standardized.

**Improvement**:
- Create a standardized template for new hosts
- Implement a host profile system for common configurations (e.g., "developer", "gaming", "minimal")
- Use conditional logic more effectively with `specialArgs`

### 4. Package Management Strategy

**Current**: Packages are defined in multiple locations (common-system.nix, user-base.nix, host-specific configs).

**Improvement**:
- Create a centralized package registry with categorized packages
- Implement package sets for different use cases (development, productivity, entertainment)
- Use `pkgs.callPackage` more extensively for better package customization

### 5. User Configuration Modularity

**Current**: User configurations are well-organized but could be more modular.

**Improvement**:
- Create role-based configuration modules (e.g., developer.nix, writer.nix, student.nix)
- Implement feature toggles for user configurations
- Better separation of application configurations from core user settings

### 6. Secrets Management Enhancement

**Current**: Basic support for sops-nix but not fully implemented.

**Improvement**:
- Create a secrets management framework
- Implement per-host secret deployment
- Add secret rotation capabilities

### 7. Testing and Validation

**Current**: Limited automated testing of configurations.

**Improvement**:
- Implement configuration validation tests
- Add CI/CD pipeline for configuration testing
- Create rollback testing procedures

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Module Restructuring
1. Create subdirectories in `modules/` for better organization
2. Move existing modules to appropriate subdirectories
3. Update flake.nix to reflect new module paths

### Phase 2: Configuration Abstraction
1. Identify duplicated configurations
2. Create reusable configuration functions
3. Implement better configuration merging strategies

### Phase 3: Host Profile System
1. Define host profile templates
2. Implement profile selection mechanism
3. Update existing hosts to use profiles

### Phase 4: Package Management
1. Create centralized package registry
2. Implement package sets
3. Update package references throughout the configuration

### Phase 5: User Configuration Modularity
1. Create role-based configuration modules
2. Implement feature toggles
3. Refactor existing user configurations

### Phase 6: Secrets Management
1. Implement secrets framework
2. Add per-host secret deployment
3. Document secrets management procedures

### Phase 7: Testing and Validation
1. Implement configuration validation tests
2. Add CI/CD pipeline
3. Create rollback testing procedures

## Benefits of Improvements

1. **Maintainability**: Better organization makes it easier to find and modify configurations
2. **Scalability**: Modular approach supports adding new hosts and features more easily
3. **Reusability**: Abstracted configurations can be shared across different contexts
4. **Reliability**: Testing and validation improve system stability
5. **Documentation**: Better structure makes the system easier to understand and document

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Incremental Changes**: Implement improvements in phases to minimize disruption
2. **Testing**: Thoroughly test each change before deployment
3. **Rollback Plans**: Maintain ability to revert changes if issues arise
4. **Documentation**: Keep documentation updated with each change
5. **Validation**: Use `nixos-rebuild test` before `nixos-rebuild switch` for all changes

## Conclusion

These architectural improvements will make the system more maintainable, scalable, and reliable while preserving all existing functionality. The phased approach ensures that improvements can be made incrementally without disrupting the user experience.
